# ANNOTATION GUIDELINES

## Preliminary comments

Each corpus has its specific set of relationship that are detailed in a separate documents. See [DD](DD_ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md), [DE](DE_ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md), [FR](FR_ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md), [GB](GB_ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md) and [US](US_ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md) annotation guidelines

## General case

The labelling of relationship between entities follow the general rule that the relation should go from the object to its attributes. For example, in the case of a link between an entity `LOC`
and an entity `INV`, the relationship should go from `INV` to `LOC`.

## Specific cases

From the set of annotated entities, the context should be sufficient to use the general rule without ambiguity. Standard cases are presented in Examples 1 to 3 below.
Two specific cases are worth mentioning:

- Multiple similar objects for a given subject (e.g. two `LOC` for a same `ASG`)
- Multiple subjects for a given object (e.g. two INV for a same `CIT`)

These cases can happen for two reasons, either because the context commands it (see examples 4 and 5) or because one of the entities has been split into multiple parts for example because of a bad OCR, or because of the wording (see example 6).

In any cases, all the corresponding relationship should be annotated.
