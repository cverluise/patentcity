## Background

Although evidence of an earlier version of patents can be found in 1449, the British patent system starts in 1623 (Plasseraud and Savignon, 1983). There were no official publications prior to 1852. To our knowledges, most patent publications earlier than 1894 have not been digitalized, and some are still missing from 1894 to 1900.

We consider all patents with a publication date between 1894 and 1980. We address all patents with kind-code A. In total, we consider 1,780,385 documents from 1894.

## 📚 Data source

From the earliest patent that we consider GB189317126A to patent GB2000001A (excluded), we collected image data (png) from Espacenet and OCRed the first page using Tesseract v5.
