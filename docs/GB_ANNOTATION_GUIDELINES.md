## Preliminary comments

The patent corpus that we consider for GB has two types of formats and spans the period 1893-1980.
The formatting of UK patent documents have evolved in time but only modestly. Typically, until patent number GB2000001, the first paragraph of the text contains most of the relevant information, which is completed by the header, whose content changes slightly over time. See Figures 1, 2 and 3 for different examples.

From GB2000001 onward, the information is located in the front-page of the patent in a structured way (see Figure 4 for an example). This only concerns 23,889 patent documents as we stop the analysis in 1980.

??? note "More on GB patents numbering"

    - Prior to 1916, patent number is given by a number preceded by the *year of application*
    - From 1916, patents are numbered from 100001 to 1605470 and then from 2000001 onward.
    - The last application we consider is 2023380


### *Format 1*, from 1894 to 1979

In the first format, from 1894 to 1979, all the information is given in the first paragraph, which starts by "I, " or "We, " and usually ends with "do hereby declare the nature of this invention to be as follows" or "for which we pray that a patent may be granted to us..."

We extract 5 different "entities" from the body of GB patents.

Entity|Content|E.g.
---|---|---
`PERS`| Person full name | <font style="border:2px solid red">Maxim Hanson Hersey `PERS`</font>, Lighting Engineer
`ORG`| Firm full name | We, <font style="border:2px solid blue">The Convex Incandescent Mantle Company Limited `ORG`</font>, Manufacturers
`CIT`| The origin of the firm or citizenship of the person | a <font style="border:2px solid yellow">subject of the king of Great Britain and Ireland `CIT`</font>,
`LOC`| Location of the person/firm| Maxim Hanson Hersey, Lighting Engineer, of <font style="border:2px solid green">145, Bethune Road, Amhurst Park, London N. `LOC`</font>.
`OCC`| Occupation of the person | Maxim Hanson Hersey, <font style="border:2px solid magenta">Lighting Engineer `OCC`</font>.

These entities are tied together with 3 types of relations.

Relation|Content|E.g.
---|---|---
`CITIZENSHIP`| Links an `ORG`/`PERS` to its `CIT` | <font style="border:2px solid red">Maxim Hanson Hersey `PERS`</font><font color="red">--></font>`CITIZENSHIP`<font color="yellow">--></font><font style="border:2px solid yellow">subject of the king of Great Britain and Ireland `CIT`</font>
`LOCATION`|Links an `ORG`/`PERS` to its `LOC` | <font style="border:2px solid red">Maxim Hanson Hersey `PERS`</font><font color="red">--></font>`LOCATION`<font color="green">--></font><font style="border:2px solid green">145, Bethune Road, Amhurst Park, London N. `LOC`</font>
`OCCUPATION`|Links an `PERS` to its `OCC`| <font style="border:2px solid red">Maxim Hanson Hersey `PERS`</font><font color="red">--></font>`OCCUPATION`<font color="blue">--></font><font style="border:2px solid magenta">Lighting Engineer `OCC`</font>

??? note "Specific labelling issues"

    - In some cases the text of the patent is repeated twice in the same document, once for the _provisional specification_ and once for the _complete specification_ (see e.g. GB132951A). In such case, all relevant entities must be labelled, even if this means labelling the same entities twice.
    -In some cases, the name of the inventor, the name of the assignee and even its address can appear at the end of the patent. Those entities must not be labelled (e.g. GB509140A).


??? note "Other meta-data in GB patents"

    The header contains some specific information including:

    - the publication date
    - the acceptance date
    - the application number
    - the publication number
    - the title
    - the technological class
    - the name of the inventor(s) - in some instance


### Format 2

In the second format, restricted to the year 1979, the information is structured in the front page of the patent. For these patents, the identity of the inventor and the assignee are clearly stated, but only the location of the assignee is given.


## Entities

### Format 1

#### `PERS`

##### General case

The tag `PERS` refers to the full name of a *patentee* person which can or cannot be directly presented as the inventor. This name usually follows "I, " or "We, " and is given in capital letters.

##### Specific cases

- *Inventor name in the header*: The name of the inventor can also be specified in the header, preceded by the mention "Inventor(s):" and usually in capital letters. In this case, we label the inventor(s) as `PERS`. See example 2.
- *Third party*: In the rare case where the inventor uses a third party to file the application (deceased, mandated), we don't tag the third party person. See example 3 where we do not tag "HAROLD WADE" as a `PERS` because the context tells us that he is not the inventor.

#### `LOC`

##### General case

The tag `LOC` refers to the full location sequence either of a tag `PERS` or a tag `ORG`. The address can be given as a full sequence with street number, street name, city, county and country. It can also be simply given by the name of the city/town/village and county (see example 2), or by a postcode (see example 3). In some cases, the location refers to a specific building (see example 4) or university (example 5) and in some other cases, the name of a nearby city is specified (see example 6).

##### Specific cases
